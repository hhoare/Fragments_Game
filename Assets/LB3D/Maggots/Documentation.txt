Maggot / Larva Game Asset

Remember: Keep it small, keep it active. Its creepiest that way. Big maggots are like puppies. You lose the effect.

For an example of main animations, open the "Demo" scene.
Use the prefab in the usual way by placing it in the scene. If you are unfamiliar with how to use animations, please see the demo scene where an animation controller is used in a basic way. It is advised that you create your own animation controller according to your own game need and style.
